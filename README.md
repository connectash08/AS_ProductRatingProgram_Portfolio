# Mock User-Product Rating Interaction System

Overview:

This project simulates a mock user-product rating interaction system using randomly generated data from the program. It serves as
a simulation to model how users rate products based on category preferences and visualize average pricing trends across different
categories. Great for showcasing data generation, feature engineering, and data visualization skills.

Features:

User Simulation - Generates funny usernames with randomized category preferences.
Product Catalog - Creates 30 synthetic products with assigned categories and prices.
Rating Logic - Users rate products higher when they match their preferences.
Data Integration - Merges user ratings with product meta-data.
Visualization - Bar chart display of averagr product prices by category.

Technologies Used:

- Numpy for numerical operations & randomness.
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib for plotting.
- Random for category selection.

**This project was written by me as a practice excersize in generating and analyzing mock recommendation data, with use of outside
resources & tutorials for brainstorming ideas.
